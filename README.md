# Simple bash script to modify terminal color palette using pywal command.
# How to use
The first time it runs, the script installs all of the necessary packages.
Otherwise, it shows a menu with options to add or remove sources, as well as to change color palette.


On the folder that script runs, it creates a directory called sources, which is where the script gets the files from.
Second option from the script allows user to remove or add content from that folder, but only works with img files (png, jpg, jpeg, img, webp..)

*IMPORTANT: the script must be by someone other than the root user.*
